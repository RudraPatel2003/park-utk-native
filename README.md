## About

ParkUTK is a proof-of-concept app that was created as an extension to my team's [SASEhack Fall 2023 project](https://sasehack-fall-2023.devpost.com/submissions/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&terms=park&sort=). The University of Tennessee has a major issue in terms of having enough available parking for students. This app crowd sources data, meaning that the users of the app can report the amount of parking spots they see in a particular garage at any given time. The results are then shown on an interactive map.

As opposed to my [hackathon submission](https://devpost.com/software/parkutk), which was a Next.js app, this project is a cross-platform mobile application, which falls more in line with its potential use case.

The backend for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/RudraPatel2003/park-utk-native-api).
